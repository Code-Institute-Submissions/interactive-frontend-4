# Zombomb
### Interactive Frontend Development
### Second Milestone Project, Code Institute by Kervin Arias

What's this all about?
This is a game that uses zoombies as bombs or granades to kill giant birds which are attacking the planet. I've got my inspiration from this article https://hackernoon.com/making-a-game-with-javascript-and-pixijs-part-1-e3235139cd6f

I came across a very useful library https://www.pixijs.com/ this is an open source available to make stunning graphics. Another useful source is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript which explains step by step how to get familiar with game development.
